# Riddler
A collection of solutions to the Riddler series on FiveThirtyEight and the Riddler book.

My solutions are normally based in computation, logic, mathematics or simulation.

Solutions are most often in Jupyter Notebooks for ease of explanation however some times in plain python or Kotlin as i see fit.
