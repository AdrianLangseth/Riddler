    "For this riddle i looked at different languages which have these letters. I started with english but it came to nothing as i saw no patterns. The \"out of the box\" clue pushed me to explore some famous languages which are not very common. Therefore i looked at greek. From here i noticed that the distance between B and T in the alphabet is the same as between E and X. Hence, from this i looked at the possibility of a modular distancing. This panned out nicely and i believe the pattern to be that if we give the letters numbers corresponding to their position in the alphabet, the formulae is as such:"
