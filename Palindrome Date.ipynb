    "\n",
    "*This past Sunday was Groundhog Day. Also, there was a football game. But to top it all off, the date, 02/02/2020, was palindromic, meaning it reads the same forwards and backwards (if you ignore the slashes).*\n",

    "*If we write out dates in the American format of MM/DD/YYYY (i.e., the two digits of the month, followed by the two digits of the day, followed by the four digits of the year), how many more palindromic dates will there be this century?*"

    "Our first restriction is that ZY must be 20, as we only concern ourselves with the current century. As the most annoying person at the last new years party continually pointed out: the decade lasts from 2011 to 2020. Following that the current century includes 2100. However, he can shove it, as the year 2100 has no month being 00, and therefore has no palindrome dates. Although when the machines inevitably take over, where 0-indexing would be universially adopted and 00|12|2100 (13th january 2100) would be valid: Touché Glenn.\n",
